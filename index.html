            <p>
             A remarkably bright workaholic, the Border Collie is an amazing dog'maybe a bit too amazing for owners without the time, energy, or means to keep it occupied. 
             These energetic dogs will settle down for cuddle time when the workday is done.<br>
             Borders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. 
             The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors and patterns. 
             The almond eyes are the focus of an intelligent expression'an intense gaze, the Border's famous 'herding eye', is a breed hallmark. 
             On the move, Borders are among the canine kingdom's most agile, balanced, and durable citizens. The intelligence, athleticism, and trainability of Borders have a perfect outlet in agility training. 
             Having a job to perform, like agility'or herding or obedience work'is key to Border happiness. Amiable among friends, they may be reserved with strangers.

             The Canaan Dog is the national dog of Israel. This quick, medium-sized pasture dog is docile with family, aloof with strangers. 
             The ever-alert Canaan is a vocal and persistent guardian of flock and home. <br>
             Canaan Dogs are lean, bushy-tailed dogs standing 19 to 24 inches at the shoulder. 
             The coat is straight and harsh, and comes in various colors and patterns. Erect, expressive ears and dark almond eyes convey an inquisitive expression. 
             Canaans move at a brisk, natural trot. They are rugged, agile, and apparently tireless, making them a nice fit for hikers and runners. 
             Canaans are clever, confident, and territorial. They will end up "owning" passive owners who haven't establish themselves as top dog in the family pack. 
             Early training and socialization are key. When positive methods are applied, these ancient wonder-dogs train beautifully. Agility, obedience, herding trials, and sentry duty are a few outlets for their work ethic.

            <p>
             Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. 
             Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. <br>
             German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. 
             The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, 
             but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. 
             German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.

            Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and'thanks to its pleading expression'cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing.<br>
            There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as dog folks say. 
            They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head. 
            A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable'all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. 
            These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.

        <p>
            The world famous 'Sleuth Hound' does one thing better than any creature on earth: find people who are lost or hiding. An off-duty Bloodhound is among the canine kingdom's most docile citizens, but he's relentless and stubborn on scent. <br>
            Bloodhounds are large, substantial dogs standing 23 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing up to 110 pounds. Their most famous features are a long, wrinkled face with loose skin; huge, drooping ears; and warm, deep-set eyes 
            that complete an expression of solemn dignity. Coat colors can be black and tan, liver and tan, or red. Powerful legs allow Bloodhounds to scent over miles of punishing terrain. As pack dogs, Bloodhounds enjoy company, including 
            other dogs and kids. They are easygoing, but their nose can sometimes lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy sniffing around are recommended. Bloodhounds are droolers, and obedience 
            training these sensitive sleuths can be a challenge.

            Upbeat, lively, inquisitive, and friendly, the jaunty Russell Terrier was developed by England's "Sporting Parson" for use in foxhunts. The adorable Russell Terrier looks like a plush toy come to life but is an eager, tireless working terrier. <br>
            These jaunty little fellows pack lots of personality into a compact, rectangular body standing 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder. Their dark, almond-shaped eyes and mobile V-shaped ears bring out the keenly intelligent expression'an endearing hallmark 
            of the breed. All three coat types are mostly white with markings that are tan or black, or both. Russells move with a free, effortless gait that announces the breed's innate confidence.
